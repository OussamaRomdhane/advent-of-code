- I wanted each day to be independent so I haven't made shared util methods, this is for convenience so I won't have to remember the API each time.
- You can run `part1` or `part2` of any day using `npx ts-node part[x].ts` where `[x]` is `1` or `2` (you will obviously need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [ts-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node) for this to work).
- Benchmark is done against the solution itself and does not include reading and formatting input.
- I'll try to include an O complexity comment at the beginning of the file when I remember to (no pressure and will mostly forget a lot).
